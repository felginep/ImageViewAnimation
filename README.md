ImageViewAnimation
==================

This project is a simple animation to display an image once it's loaded from the background.

It's designed to be used with [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage).

To build the project, make sure to update submodule first:

- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
